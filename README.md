## Example Combo Replays

These examples are meant to give you an idea of the deck's strategy and usually starts with 1-2 cards. This is because for more complex combos, a single replay wouldn't be enough since there could be dozens of possibilities depending on the starting hand.<br>

For some decks, there might not be a combo because:
* The deck doesn't have a combo but instead plays in response to opponent's actions, eg. archetypes like 'D.D. Invader' or 'Soulbound.'
* There isn't a basic combo; it varies significantly depending on the cards in starting hand. For example, for decks like 'External Worlds' or 'Crearmor,' almost any hand with at least 3 different monsters is playable, but everytime the combo is slightly different.
* I haven't had the time, I have created a lot of archetypes. I'll try to add at least 1 example combo for each deck where it's possible and update those that are no longer feasible due to banned cards.

### Engine, old and banned combos

There are some replays that ends with 'engine', 'old' or 'banned'.

* Engine combo -> Shows the combo for an engine that can be included in different decks. It doesn't represent the final board because it often doesn't even use the Normal Summon.
* Old combo -> These have been rendered obsolete by new cards, but I have left them to showcase a combo that was still valid at the time. For example, 'Dark King' with its new cards can perform the combo with greater consistency without having to play 'Impcantation' cards.
* Banned combo -> These combos on the other hand, are no longer viable because a card in the combo has been banned. For instance, 'True King of All Calamities' is now banned, so the 'Morhai' combo that Summons it is no longer valid.

### Extra info on specific combo

* Hydra_2cards_anti_Impermanence -> It's called this way because the first 'Hydra Summoner' Summoned can defend itself against 'Infinite Impermanence' while 'Rock Hydra' is attached to her. (So detach the other material to activate its effect!)
* Undead_2cards -> I've noticed that the placeholder cards in hand that are not used in the combo are 'Eldlich' cards, but this is an inaccuracy in the replay. I should redo it using cards that are really not usable in the combo. (It might be confusing that I'm not using them when i can because they are meant to be placeholders.)
* PrimevalForest_Sunavalon_3cards -> It's the combo achievable in a best-case scenario, but it's not the optimal way to play the deck. It sacrifices too much consistency to occasionally add 1 'Benghalancer the Resurgent' to the final board. In the current decklist, I've actually removed both 'Sunseed Shadow' and 'Sunvine Healer', and use 'Sunvine' cards only as extenders.
