## Example Combo Replays

Download the [zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Secuter/SecuterYGOCustomCards-Replays/main/replay.zip) with all replays.

These examples are meant to give you an idea of the deck's strategy and usually starts with 1-2 cards. This is because for more complex combos, a single replay wouldn't be enough since there could be dozens of possibilities depending on the starting hand.<br>
There should be a combo replay for almost all archetypes, except when there isn't a basic combo, see the categories below.
For new archetypes or if used cards are banned, I will try to add/update the combo as soon as possible.
 
For some decks, there might not be a combo because:
* The deck doesn't have a combo but instead plays in response to opponent's actions. [D.D. Invader, Soulbound]
* There isn't a basic combo; it varies significantly depending on the cards in starting hand. Almost any hand with at least 3 different monsters is playable, but everytime the combo is different. [External Worlds, Crearmor, Arcaeonix]
* The deck starts second and doesn't have an OTK combo; the plays heavily depend on what the opponent has. [Blaze Dragonlady, Eternal Storm]
* The deck mills cards from the top of the deck; the combo depends on what gets milled. [Ancient Oracle, Worldless]

### Replay Tags

There are some replays that ends with 'old', 'banned', etc. ...

* Engine -> Shows the combo for an engine that can be included in different decks. It doesn't represent the final board because it often doesn't even use the Normal Summon.
* Old -> These have been rendered obsolete by new cards, but I have left them to showcase a combo that was still valid at the time. For example, 'Dark King' with its new cards can perform the combo with greater consistency without having to play 'Impcantation' cards.
* Banned -> These combos on the other hand, are no longer viable because a card in the combo has been banned. For instance, 'True King of All Calamities' is now banned, so the 'Morhai' combo that Summons it is no longer valid.
* Example -> This is a example starting hand, the deck can start a similar combo also with different cards.

### Extra info on specific combo

* Hydra_2cards_anti_Impermanence -> It's called this way because the first 'Hydra Summoner' Summoned can defend itself against 'Infinite Impermanence' while 'Rock Hydra' is attached to her. (So detach the other material to activate its effect!)
* Undead_2cards -> I've noticed that the placeholder cards in hand that are not used in the combo are 'Eldlich' cards, but this is an inaccuracy in the replay. I should redo it using cards that are really not usable in the combo. (It might be confusing that I'm not using them when I can because they are meant to be placeholders.)
* PrimevalForest_Sunavalon_3cards -> It's the combo achievable in a best-case scenario, but it's not the optimal way to play the deck. It sacrifices too much consistency to occasionally add 1 'Benghalancer the Resurgent' to the final board. In the current decklist, I've actually removed both 'Sunseed Shadow' and 'Sunvine Healer', and I'm now using 'Sunvine' cards only as extenders.
* Arcaeonix -> This is a example starting hand, almost any initial hand with 3 different archetype cards can do the combo.
